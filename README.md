This is an end to end Machine Learning project for fake news classification. The dataseet used here are from the open source data library Kaggle. Here is a link to the datasets: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/clmentbisaillon/fake-and-real-news-dataset.

For text data preprocessiong, CountVectorizer and TfidfTransformer methods have been used.
Two machine learning models have been used and compared in the projects. The first model is Multinomial Naive Bayes and the second is Support Vector Machine classification.
